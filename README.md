# arcticBases
Project created for university assignment for the Arctic Research Institute of Sofia University.
Used electronjs for building the app with mapboxjs for visualisating the map itself, also I built a webscraper for wikipedia table elements to colect data which to be populated 
on the map.


#How to run the app
1. run 'npm install' command to install all dependencies
2. run 'npm start' to launch the app and test it
3. run 'npm make' to build the app
